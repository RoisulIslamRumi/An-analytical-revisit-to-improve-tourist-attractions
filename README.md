## About
This is a project for the Machine Learning &amp; Pattern Recognition Course of University of Windsor. In the project, we tried to predict the tourist attractions in Europe that needed more government intervention to attract more visitors. We implemented classical clustering algorithms to solve this problem.

## Dataset
The <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Tarvel+Review+Ratings">dataset</a> has been collected from the UCI machine learning repository. It contains 5456 user ratings from Google reviews. The reviews are done from 25 categories/attractions across Europe.
## Goal
Our target was to answer the following research question.
  ### Research Question
  Which attractions should be prioritized more by the government and local authorities to provide better customer satisfaction in Europe?
